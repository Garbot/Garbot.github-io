# Using S

Amazon S3 instances are great for hosting simple websites.  One major drawback you'll run into, however, is the lack of support for secure connections.  It's possible to get around this, however, by using some of the other services.

## Create S3 Bucket

## Cloudfront

## Route 53


## Getting SSL cert

## Uploading the SSL Certificate 

We'll need to use the AWS CLI tool in order to upload the certificate to IAM.
