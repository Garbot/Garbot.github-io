You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into **bold/**italics/headings/tables/etc.


#### I heard you like code snippets

{% highlight javascript linenos%}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
