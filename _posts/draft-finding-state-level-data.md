#Finding State Level Data
Finding state level data can be a bit problematic, depending on what you are looking for.  Federal data is very accessible through several avenues such as **[[cite]]**, but there are no consistent overarching regulations governing access to state-level data such as state congressional districts. A search on (www.data.gov) for congressional districts returns some states, but not others.

For the following example, I wanted to obtain GEOJSON data on state congressional districts for the North Carolina General Assembly to be used in a [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) data visualization.  Federal data [[from where?]] is easily obtainable, but state data is inconsistent.  Several states have this data available on (www.data.gov), but North Carolina does not.  There isn't a universal source of state-level data where users can say, write a script to pull data from an API for all 50 states and get consistent results.
